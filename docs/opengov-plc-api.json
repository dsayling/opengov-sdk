Call this endpoint with the file metadata to receive:\n   - A `fileID` for referencing the file\n   - A pre-signed URL for uploading\n2. Use the pre-signed URL to upload your file:\n   - Send a `PUT` request to the URL\n   - Include the file content in the request body\n   - Set the `Content-Type` header to match the file type\n   - Include the header `x-ms-blob-type` with the value `BlockBlob`\n3. Once uploaded, the file can be associated with entities:\n   - Currently supports association with [Record Attachments](operation:external/plce-api/plce-api.oas/record-attachments/addRecordAttachment)\n   - Each association creates a clone of the original file\n   - The same file can be reused across multiple entities\n\nThe pre-signed URL expires after 1 hour.\n\nFor more information on uploading files, see the [Azure Blob Service REST API documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/put-blob)\n\n### Permissions Required\n`File Write`",

First, upload your file using the Files API:\n   - Use [POST /files](operation:external/plce-api/plce-api.oas/files/createFileUpload) to get a pre-signed upload URL\n   - Upload your file using the pre-signed URL\n   - Keep the returned `fileID` for the next step\n2. Then use this endpoint to create the record attachment:\n   - Provide the fileID to associate the file\n   - The file will be cloned, creating an independent copy for this record\n\n##### Attachment Types and Versioning\nAttachments can be either ad-hoc or template-based:\n\nUsing attachmentID:\n- Creates a new version of any existing attachment (ad-hoc or template-based)\n- The new file replaces the current version\n- Previous versions remain accessible in the attachment history\n\nUsing attachmentTemplateID:\n- Associates the attachment with a specific template\n- If no attachment exists for this template, creates a new one\n- If an attachment already exists for this template, updates it with a new version\n- Takes precedence over attachmentID if both are provided\n\n### Permissions Required\n`Record Write`",
